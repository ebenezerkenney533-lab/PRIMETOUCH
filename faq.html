    <details>
      <summary>How long does a full respray take?</summary>
      <p>Typically, a full respray takes between 7 to 14 days. This depends on the amount of prep work, dent repairs, and drying time required for a showroom finish.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Can you match my car's original color exactly?</summary>
      <p>Yes. We use a digital spectrometer and factory paint codes to ensure a 100% color match, even for older or faded paint.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Do you offer a warranty on the paintwork?</summary>
      <p>Absolutely. We provide a 3-year warranty against peeling or fading, giving you peace of mind that the finish will last.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How soon can I wash my car after it's been sprayed?</summary>
      <p>You can wash it with water after 48 hours, but we recommend waiting 30 days before using high-pressure jet washes or wax to allow the paint to fully cure.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Do I need to bring the car in for a quote?</summary>
      <p>While photos help for a rough estimate, we prefer seeing the vehicle in person to give you an accurate, no-obligation quote.</p>
